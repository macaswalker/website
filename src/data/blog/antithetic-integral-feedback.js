 How do systems maintain behaviour in the face of environmental change?  
  ## AlphaFold and Beyond
  DeepMind's AlphaFold has demonstrated remarkable accuracy in predicting protein structures, achieving results comparable to experimental methods. Building upon this foundation, researchers are now exploring how to extend these capabilities.
  
  ## Implications for Drug Discovery
  Accurate protein structure prediction accelerates drug discovery by enabling more precise virtual screening and rational drug design. This has significant implications for addressing previously undruggable targets.
  
  ## Challenges and Future Directions
  Despite these advances, challenges remain in predicting structures of multi-protein complexes, intrinsically disordered proteins, and dynamic structural changes. Hybrid approaches combining machine learning with physics-based simulations show promise in addressing these limitations.
  
  ## Conclusion
  Machine learning approaches to protein folding prediction represent a paradigm shift in structural biology, with far-reaching implications for biotechnology and medicine.
