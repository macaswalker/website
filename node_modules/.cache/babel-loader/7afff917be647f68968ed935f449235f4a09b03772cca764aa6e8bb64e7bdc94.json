OpenFOI is a streamlined, AI-powered tool for managing FOI workflows end-to-end. Built for journalists, public officials, and civil society organizations, it simplifies response drafting, redaction, export, and request tracking — all in a single interface.\n\n### Video Walkthrough\n\n<iframe \n  width=\"100%\" \n  height=\"400\" \n  src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/tyYoI61JAOo\" \n  title=\"YouTube video player\" \n  frameborder=\"0\" \n  allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" \n  allowfullscreen\n></iframe>\n\n### Features\n\n- GPT-powered response drafting with integrated FOI exemptions  \n- Manual and rule-based redaction with exemption tagging  \n- Blackout-style redacted PDF + styled DOCX export  \n- CSV upload for batch request ingestion  \n- Request tracker with metadata, reference numbers, and response history  \n- Session-based state saving for seamless navigation  \n- Customisable exemptions system compliant with UK FOI Act 2000\n\n### Technologies Used\n\n- **Streamlit** – lightweight frontend for rapid UI development  \n- **Python** – core backend logic and redaction tools  \n- **OpenAI GPT-4** – for AI-assisted response generation and suggestions  \n- **spaCy** – optionally used for named entity recognition (NER)  \n- **FPDF + python-docx** – for redacted PDF and styled DOCX exports  \n- **Git LFS** – for storing large media assets (e.g. video walkthroughs)\n\n### Reflections\n\nTony Blair announced that *one of his biggest regrets from government was pushing through the FOI Act* (cite) — apparently it leads to a risk-averse culture in the civil service.  \nAs someone who *believes the civil service should encourage risk taking and increase the risk tolerance of its civil servants* (cite), maybe better work should go into trying to reverse the FOI Act instead of making it easier.  \nAs you may imagine, it is a relatively nebulous question as to how much FOI requests cost the central government each year.
